## About

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Tkinter library. The player controls a snake to eat food, causing it to grow longer, with the objective of avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail. The game includes features such as directional controls using arrow keys, a pause function, and increasing difficulty as the snake grows.

This project was undertaken during my final year of high school in a group of two, providing a valuable opportunity to develop and enhance teamwork skills.

## Installation

To install and run the Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Victor-Pavageau/snake-game.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd snake-game
```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python installed.

## Usage

To start playing the Snake Game, simply run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Try to eat the food without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail. Your score increases with each piece of food eaten.
